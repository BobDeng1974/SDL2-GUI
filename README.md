SDL2-GUI
========

an SDL2 Opengl 3.x GUI system based on HTML and CSS

I will start working towards finishing this project in the near future.
It seems a good number of people like this and I'd like to deliver a final product. 
I've been learning a lot about C++ programming and design. I'll be sticking with a simple interface
and getting everything running again soon.

Here is an image of rendering a single xml file written with HTML tags
